# Draw Functions

Draw functions are the functions you import from the `draw` module and call within a `canvas` body. Depending on how and where you call them they can cause stuff to be drawn to the canvas or modify what is already on the canvas.

- [shapes](./shapes) For drawing shapes on the canvas.
- [grouping](./grouping) For grouping other draw functions together.
- [styling](.) For changing the styling of other draw functions.
- [transformations](.) For transforming the points on the canvas.
- [projection](.)
