# Palette

A palette is a function of the form `index => style` that takes an index, that can be any <Type>in?</Type> and returns a canvas style dictionary. If passed the string `"len"` it must return the length of its unique styles. An example use for palette functions is the plot library, which can use palettes to apply different styles per plot.
