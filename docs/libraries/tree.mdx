The tree library allows the drawing of diagrams with simple tree layout algorithms.

## Nodes
A tree node is an array consisting of the node's value at index 0 followed by its child nodes. For the default `draw-node` function, the value (the first item) of a node must be of type <Type>content</Type>.

Example of a list of nodes:
```typc example
cetz.tree.tree(
  (
    [A],
    (
      [B],
      (
        [C],
        ([D],)
      )
    )
  ),
  direction: "right"
)
```

Example of a tree of nodes:
```typc example
cetz.tree.tree(
  (
    [A],
    (
      [B],
      [C]
    ),
    (
      [D],
      [E]
    )
  ),
  direction: "right"
)
```

## Drawing and Styling Tree Nodes
The `tree()` function takes an optional `draw-node:` and `draw-edge:` callback function that can be used to customice node and edge drawing.

The `draw-node` function must take the current node and its parents node anchor as arguments and return one or more elements.

For drawing edges between nodes, the `draw-edge` function must take two node anchors and the target node as arguments and return one or more elements.

```typc example
import cetz.tree
let data = ([\*], ([A], [A.A], [A.B]), ([B], [B.A]))
tree.tree(
  data,
  direction: "right",
  draw-node: (node, ..) => {
    circle((), radius: .35, fill: blue, stroke: none)
    content((), text(white, [#node.content]))
  },
  draw-edge: (from, to, ..) => {
    let (a, b) = (from + ".center", to + ".center")
    line((a, .4, b), (b, .4, a))
  }
)
```
